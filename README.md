# hello-world
this is just a starting respository

My name is Chris MacDougall and I am using GitHub to explore it's uses and advantages with CI/CD architecture including DevOps!

I am a huge Docker container fan and looking at the ever evolving world of cloud platforms.  Also looking at Jenkins and Docker integration to support automated builds with testing and security checks.
